# OpenWiFi Release 2.1

## What is OpenWiFi?

TIP OpenWiFi is an open source community project that believes in democratizing premium Wi-Fi experiences for multiple market use cases. The TIP approach to OpenWiFi creates an open source disaggregated technology stack without any vendor lock in. OpenWiFi offers premium managed Wi-Fi features, local break-out design, cloud native open source controller, and an open source AP firmware operating system tested nightly.

TIP OpenWiFi is the industry's first CI/CD open source Wi-Fi eco-system. Built nightly with a strong community of Wi-Fi leaders, new features are unit tested in automated RF chambers and checked from cloud to ground for Wi-Fi performance and conformance.

OpenWiFi 2.0 introduces management and telemetry based on uCentral offering expanded selection of managed devices including smaller APs and PoE access switches.
