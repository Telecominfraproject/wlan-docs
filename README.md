# OpenWiFi Release 3.0.0

## What is OpenWiFi?

TIP OpenWiFi is an open source community project that believes in democratizing premium Wi-Fi experiences for multiple market use cases. The TIP approach to OpenWiFi creates an open source disaggregated technology stack without any vendor lock in.

Features normally only present in commercial enterprise WLAN offerings are available in TIP OpenWiFi. These premium Wi-Fi features enable a number of market solutions for developers, integrators and operators to explore.

TIP OpenWiFi stack enables commercial integrations via cloud native open source services for management and network visibility combined with an open source AP firmware operating system tested nightly.

TIP OpenWiFi Continuous Integration quality testing runs nightly exercising thousands of Wi-Fi performance, conformance and feature unit tests.

Support for a broad range of device platforms with the ability for Community to contribute additional device support and or cloud features sets TIP OpenWiFi apart from all other open projects.

Joining TIP and the OpenWiFi project is both free and easy.

### Getting Started

The most common use cases for TIP OpenWiFi are managed WLAN most often associated with premium enterprise Wi-Fi service offerings. TIP OpenWiFi presents these premium features over a number of deployment options.

TIP OpenWiFi devices have management and telemetry exposed via a single websocket to the OpenWiFi Gateway (OWGW) microservice. The OWGW is supported by database, message bus, and the OpenWiFi Security (OWSEC) microservice for northbound API integration. This represents the minimum to deploy TIP OpenWiFi.

This minimum set of services enables commercial vendor integration adding TIP OpenWiFi device support to existing Wi-Fi controllers.

Refer to the sections on SDK Installation and Overview for further information.

For additional value added services, TIP OpenWiFi also provides User Interface, Firmware Management, Provisioning and Analytics services. All services are independently deployed and integrated based on commercial adoption model.

See [Developer Resources](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-docs/blob/2.9.0/broken-reference/README.md) for API level information and [Code Repositories](openwifi-stack/repositories.md) for source code guidance.
