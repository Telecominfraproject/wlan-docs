# Open Wi-Fi

## What is Open Wi-Fi?

TIP Open Wi-Fi is an open source community project that believes in democratizing premium Wi-Fi experiences for multiple market use cases. The TIP approach to Open Wi-Fi creates an open source disaggregated technology stack without any vendor lock in. Open Wi-Fi offers premium managed Wi-Fi features, local break-out design, cloud native open source controller, and an open source AP firmware operating system tested nightly.
