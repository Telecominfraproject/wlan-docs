# Passpoint® Cloud SDK Configuration

In earlier sections of OpenWiFi documentation, the association of Access Point Equipment and SSID Profiles were described. 

For Passpoint® configuration, each Equipment Profile may reference multiple SSID Profiles. Within the SSID Profile, an association to RADIUS and Passpoint® Profile is made. 

From the Passpoint® Profile, an Operator, Venue and multiple Identity Providers are defined.
