# Restricted Unit Support

Starting release v2.8.0, APNOS allows the ability for community members to provide regulatory domain restrictions as their end product use cases.  APNOS and the SDK provides generic building blocks for restricting various aspects of the unit.&#x20;

The initial requirements for this feature are captured [here](https://telecominfraproject.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/WIFI/pages/1717338113/Standard+TIP+AP+SKU+with+FCC+certification).&#x20;

By default APNOS is open and not considered restricted.&#x20;
