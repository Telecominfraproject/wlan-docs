# Open Source First

TIP OpenWiFi is a community-developed, disaggregated Wi-Fi software system, offered as free open-source software. Our solution includes a cloud SDK, simple and customizable APIs, and enterprise-grade Access Point (AP) firmware, designed and validated to work seamlessly together.

TIP OpenWiFi ensures there is no vendor lock in. Contributions to the Open Source project are managed by the Membership to ensure compliance with Berkeley Source Distribution (BSD) license and TIP charter. In addition, the end-to-end architecture is curated to ensure an open environment.

## Contribute to the project

Membership to the TIP OpenWiFi project is free with the request to contribute as code, test, documentation or deployment. Participation and focus is governed by the PG Charter, Antitrust Guidelines and IPR Policies.
