# About OpenWiFi

Established in Q42019, the TIP OpenWiFi solution goal has been to break vendor lock-in through disaggregation architectures, open APIsâ€”with common embedded software and management that is both community- and commercially-supported.

Available for use as a completely Open Source reference, ODM vendors can easily adopt TIP OpenWiFi platforms as either a complimentary addition to hardware offers or as an entirely TIP OpenWiFi based hardware offer.

Vendors and operators can use the community project as a complete solution, extend the software stack based on design goals, or use only the components desired for deployment. The OpenWiFi community includes hardware ODM vendors, software DevOps, OEM, and System Integrators.
