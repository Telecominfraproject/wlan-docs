# Getting Started

There are two ways to get started with TIP Open Wi-Fi. For those interested in 'rolling their own' fell free to continue through the Cloud SDK Installation and related information to configure and consume the open source stack. Note you will need to join the TIP Open Converged Wireless PG for this. 

Interested in getting started with a partner? Obtaining a TIP AP directly or via a partner is simple and these partners will help setup cloud trial environment with you.
