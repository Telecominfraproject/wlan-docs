# Configurations

Within the example Venue, creating configuration templates for SSIDs and or other configuration sections are possible. These configurations are inherited by device memberships at the Venue level.&#x20;

It is therefore possible to define many Venues, Child Venues, and Inventory associations that will then inherit global templates from entities in addition to aggregation of Venue templates.&#x20;
